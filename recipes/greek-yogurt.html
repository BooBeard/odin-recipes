    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I have this for breakfast most mornings. The extra calcium is a plus. I
      add honey and granola for a delicious and filling breakfast. You can use
      your imagination with additions such as fresh fruit, preserves, or even
      chopped nuts. I have made this with flavored yogurt, but I prefer plain.
      You can even use the yogurt fluid (whey) instead of water in baking
      recipes.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>coffee filters, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line a colander with coffee filters and set it in a large bowl. Add
        yogurt and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Place in the refrigerator
        for 6 hours to overnight; the fluid from the yogurt will collect in the
        bottom of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop yogurt out of the coffee filters and back into the original
        container for storage. Discard accumulated fluid or reserve for other
        use.
